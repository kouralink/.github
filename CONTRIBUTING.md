# Contributing to KouraLink

Welcome to KouraLink! We appreciate your interest in contributing. Before you get started, please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

## Branching Model

We follow the Gitflow branching model:

- **master:** Represents the latest stable release. Only accepts pull requests from the `release` branch.
- **develop:** Represents the latest development changes. Only accepts pull requests from feature branches.
- **feature branches:** Start new features or improvements from the `develop` branch.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch from `develop` for your contribution.

```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name develop
```

2. Make your changes, commit, and push to your fork.

  ```bash
  git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```

3. Submit a pull request to the develop branch of the main repository.

    - Clearly describe the changes and the purpose of your pull request.
    - Reference any related issues.

## Pull Request Acceptance Criteria

  - Follow our coding standards and conventions.
  - Include tests for new features or bug fixes.
  - Update documentation when necessary.
  - Ensure that your changes do not introduce breaking changes.
